* Very comprehensive report!
* Good analysis in Experiment 3.ii, where having few entries seems to decrease the % of successful transactions, but with more entries the % increases.
* It is nice that you did both extensions (timey and forward validation)!
* Forward validation:
  - handler should ask to remove the read operations of the transaction for each entry if it is requested to abort
  - validator: you should keep the reference in the check messages (and the corresponding responses)
