* Very comprehensive report!
* When receiving an accept and Round < Voted, 'acceptor(Name, Promised, Round, Voted, PanelId)' must be 'acceptor(Name, Promised, Voted, Value, PanelId)'. Note that this mistake might be affecting your conclusions.
* Fault tolerance:
  - You'd better save the acceptor state before sending 'vote' messages (only if modified)
  - When receiving an accept and Round < Voted, you are currently saving a wrong state
  - You must invoke pers:store in the init function to save the PanelId when Pn is na
